# CrosshairMod v0.2
A Blackwake Mod that adds a crosshair

Simply copy and paste the *CrosshairMod.dll* and the *chSettings.sett* 
files from the *bin/Release* directory into your Blackwake directory under */Blackwake_Data/Managed/Mods*

## Customization
With Version v0.3 you can now toggle the crosshair with *J*, and you can open a customization interface with *H*. This now lets you edit virtually every aspect of the current crosshair design, and even saves it to the settings so that your customization will still be there after restarting the game,
